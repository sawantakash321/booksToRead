# booksToRead

This is a list of books to read before you die:)

It is impossible to fit the world’s wisdom and experience in just 101 books. However, these are indisputably among the finest works of humankind, and more importantly, among those that I have read and can heartily recommend. I may have left out someone’s favourite, but that may be because I haven’t read it yet, I don’t know the language, or there are no good translations.

To me, the idea of Great Books is a collection of books that are eternal in their message, books that go beyond the ordinary in teasing out fundamental principles, great ideas, powerful emotions and experiences, books that are transcendental. I have therefore left out many works of science and history as they are ultimately temporal. This does not in any way lessen Euclid’s Elements, Apollonius’ Conics, Copernicus’ On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres, Galileo’s Sidereus Nuncius, or Darwin’s The Origin of Species. It does not take away from Gibbon’s magisterial The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire or Livy’s Ab Urbe Condita. Ultimately, this list is subjective, and while I prioritise literature and philosophy over science and history in matters of spirit, you need not!

Another problem with compiling a list of the greatest books is that it privileges one form of literature over others, the long form over shorter poems. Thus, to our great loss, we leave out the works of Sappho, WB Yeats, WH Auden, Rainer Maria Rilke, Novalis, and Ezra Pound. Nonetheless, here are 101 great books one must read and then re-read.
